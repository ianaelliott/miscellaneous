# Miscellaneous

### Files included in this public repo:

#### golf.R
Code to create a golf "Auto Caddy". Feed in your estimated driving range distances with each club. Create a chart of your distances that you can carry around the course. Predict the club you need for any distance required (and vice versa).

#### rtc-k.R
A function to reverse-engineer the k values for hyperbolic inter-temporal choice experiments a la Kirby & Marakovic (1996: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03210748). Means you can create experiments with more sensible amounts (e.g., rounded to $10s and $100s) with the same k values as Kirby's studies.

#### rba-boot-function.R
A bootstrap function to create a distribution for the Risk Matrix 2000/s risk assessment. Lets you resample risk assessment scores to estimate the impact of likely known measurement error, using published Area Under the Curve stats for your context.
